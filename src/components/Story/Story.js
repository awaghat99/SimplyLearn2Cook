          Our Story began one summer, when on his lunch break, a chef from Blackburn realised young people are
          forgetting how to cook!
          <br /> Determined to start a revolution, he began formulating ideas for cooking workshops
          <br /> And over time the ideas has morphed into a platform, with a great emphasis on the importance
          of a healthy lifestyle
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          There’s an <span className="red">ongoing child obesity epidemic;</span> and it’s{" "}
          <span className="red">accelerating</span>
          <span className="red">
            <br /> –37.7% of children aged 10 & 11 within the UK are obese or overweight
            <br /> –Since 2006 the proportion of obese 10- & 11-year-olds has risen, such that now more than
            11 Year 6 children out of 50 are obese
          </span>
          <br /> The stats and facts show the need for effective interventions to tackle childhood obesity and
          to promote healthy lifestyles
          <br /> Practical cooking skills are not being taught anymore in UK schools-
